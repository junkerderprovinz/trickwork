"""Generate the README's download buttons from one template.

Two rows: the manual and the Windows and macOS builds, then Linux, the
container and the source.

Height and corner radius are the Buy Me a Coffee button's (245.3 tall, rx 38.2),
so both stand the same height at the same width. The width is 720 rather than
841.9, which left a third of the face empty beside the longest word.

Each button is filled in its platform's colour and has no outline. macOS takes
Apple's space grey, since black disappears into GitHub's dark theme.

The logos are the platforms' own marks from Font Awesome Free (CC BY 4.0 for the
icons; see scripts/brand-paths/). Each is a trademark of its owner, used
unmodified and only to name the platform a button downloads for, with no claim
of endorsement by or affiliation with Microsoft, Apple, the Linux Foundation,
or Docker. The ZIP is Font Awesome's file-zipper, nobody's mark.

Run from anywhere:  python scripts/gen_download_buttons.py
Writes .github/assets/download-buttons/*.svg, which are committed, and the
button rows in README.md between their markers, all of them showing one
sprite, .github/assets/download-buttons/buttons.svg.
